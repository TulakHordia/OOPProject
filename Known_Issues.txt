>   * Known Issues
> * * * For the first part I have used the allQuestions list, located in 'Manager' class, line 28, 124.
> * * * I copied the 'ArrayList' to a 'TreeSet' collection (Option [15] in the menu) for Question 12.
> * * * The 'TreeSet' sorting is done by the comparing the Strings length by using a Comparator function.
> * * * For Question 13, I copied the 'TreeSet' to an 'ArrayList' (Option [16] in the menu).
> * * * The 'ArrayList' duplication check is done by another class called 'StringComparator', it checks whether the strings are of the same length
> * * * plus if they contain the same amount of the letter 'a'.
> * * * For Question 14, I copied the ArrayList to a newly sorted 'ArrayList' but this time I used the 'TreeSet's comparator function to sort it.
> * * * Everything is printed in options [17], [18], [19].
