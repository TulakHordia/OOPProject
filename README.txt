## About / Synopsis
Whole project is complete.
A program used to create, edit and manipulate questions.
Create exams automatically or even manually and save them into a .txt file.
Import/Export binary files, save to .txt files.

## Usage
Launch the program, everything else should be self-explanatory on how it works.

## Content
Contains a way to add a new question + answer. (American or an Open one)
Double clicking the questions table will enter "edit mode" and allow you to edit the question (by pressing Enter when done).
Can see the Answers for an american question in a separate window.
Can import & export files in and out of the program.
Can opt into creating an automatic exam with set amount of questions or a manual one by selecting them in the table.
Functions to manually create an exam with the available questions or rather let the program create one for you.

* Project consists of 4 Packages working in an MVC module.
* Model, View, Controller and Listeners.
* Listeners listen to changes in the View and Model classes and update the Controller accordingly.
* View package consists of an Abstract interface for every GUI stage.

## Work to be done
Nothing, project is done, good luck to us. :)
